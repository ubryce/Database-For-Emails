# SQL Database For Emails
 A school project to save and store emails from an XML file into a database and users are able to query over the database and search for certain words by specifying for body, subject, to/from, date then returning the full email that contains the key words. 
 
## What I learned
* How to efficiently store files 
* How to loop through the files efficiently while looking for key words that the user inputted
